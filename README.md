# üè• PubMed RAG: Medical Literature Analysis with BigQuery and Gemini

This repository contains notebooks and resources that demonstrate how to build RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) applications for medical literature analysis using Google Cloud BigQuery vector search and Vertex AI Gemini models.

## Overview

[PubMed RAG](https://github.com/WandLZhang/pubmed-rag) provides a complete pipeline for analyzing medical cases against PubMed literature using advanced AI capabilities. This repository demonstrates how to extract medical information from case notes, search relevant PubMed articles using vector similarity, score and rank articles with customizable criteria, and generate evidence-based analyses with proper citations.

The project converts the user experience from the [Capricorn Medical Research Application](https://capricorn-medical-research.web.app/) into interactive Colab notebooks, making it accessible for both clinicians and data scientists.

## Features

- üî¨ **Medical Information Extraction**: Automatically extract disease diagnoses and actionable events from clinical case notes
- üîç **Vector Search**: Search PubMed literature using BigQuery vector similarity with text embeddings
- üìä **Dynamic Scoring**: Customizable scoring criteria for ranking articles based on relevance, impact, and quality
- ü§ñ **AI-Powered Analysis**: Generate comprehensive literature syntheses using Gemini models
- üí¨ **Interactive Chat**: Ask questions about medical cases and get evidence-based answers
- üìà **Two-Phase Analysis**: Progressive search with event coverage tracking for comprehensive results

## Quick Start Guide

### üöÄ For Clinicians (No Coding Required)

1. Open the [Clinician Example notebook](PubMed_RAG_Clinician_Example.ipynb)
2. Click **Runtime ‚Üí Run all** (or press Ctrl/Cmd + F9)
3. Authenticate with your Google account
4. Use the interactive Gradio app to:
   - Paste your medical case notes
   - Extract disease and events automatically
   - Search and analyze PubMed literature
   - Generate comprehensive analysis reports

### üíª For Data Scientists

1. Open the [Data Scientist Example notebook](PubMed_RAG_Data_Scientist_Example.ipynb)
2. Configure your Google Cloud project
3. Customize the analysis pipeline:
   ```python
   # Define custom scoring criteria
   CUSTOM_CRITERIA = [
       {"name": "clinical_trial", "weight": 50},
       {"name": "pediatric_focus", "weight": 60},
       # Add your own criteria
   ]
   
   # Process medical case
   results = process_medical_case(
       case_text,
       default_articles=10,
       min_per_event=3
   )
   ```

## Architecture

![Medical Literature Analysis Architecture](https://github.com/WandLZhang/pubmed-rag/blob/main/visuals/1.png?raw=true)

The system uses:
- **BigQuery**: Vector database for PubMed article embeddings
- **Vertex AI Gemini**: LLM for information extraction and analysis
- **Text Embeddings**: For semantic similarity search
- **Dynamic Scoring**: Customizable relevance ranking

## Key Components

### 1. Medical Information Extraction
Extract structured information from unstructured case notes:
- Primary disease diagnosis
- Actionable events (treatments, mutations, complications)
- Clinical concepts for literature search

### 2. Vector Search Pipeline
- Generates embeddings for case queries
- Searches PubMed database using BigQuery vector similarity
- Returns most relevant articles based on semantic matching

### 3. Article Scoring System
Dynamic scoring based on:
- Journal impact factor (SJR)
- Publication recency
- Event matching
- Study type and quality
- Custom criteria

### 4. Literature Synthesis
Generate comprehensive analyses including:
- Executive summaries
- Key findings by concept
- Methodological landscape
- Knowledge gaps
- Evidence-based recommendations
